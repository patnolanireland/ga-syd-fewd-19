        <h1>CSS Normalise</h1>
        
        <p>The <code>head</code> of this document includes a CSS Normalise file before the styles we will write ourselves in order to style the page.  If you have a look in the file you will see there are many styles applied.  All it seeks to do is provide a consitent styling accross different browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer.</p>
        
        <p>One of the most obvious changes is to have a <code>margin </code> of 0 applied to the body</p>
